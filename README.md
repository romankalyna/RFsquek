## üîß Hardware

### Core Components
- MCU: ESP32 Dev Board (240MHz dual-core, Wi‚ÄëFi/Bluetooth)
- RF Module: CC1101 Sub‚Äë1GHz transceiver (SPI interface)
- Display: 1.14" ST7789 135√ó240 color TFT LCD (rotation = 3)
- Power: HW-441 3.3V regulator with 4√óAA battery pack (6V input)

### User Interface
- Buttons: Two tactile switches (SELECT/BACK) with INPUT_PULLUP configuration
- Potentiometer: Analog control for frequency tuning and menu navigation
- Antenna: SMA connector for external antenna (433MHz optimized)

### Pin Configuration
- Shared SPI bus (VSPI): SCK=18, MOSI=23, MISO=19
  - Note: The TFT does NOT use MISO. MISO (GPIO19) is used by the CC1101 only.
- Display (ST7789): CS=5, DC=16, RST=17, BLK=hard-wired ON
- CC1101: CS=27, GDO0=26, GDO2=25
- Controls: BTN_SELECT=32, BTN_BACK=33, POT=34 (ADC1)

### Power Requirements
- Operating voltage: 3.3V regulated
- Current consumption: ~80‚Äì150mA (depends on display brightness and RF activity)
- Battery life: 8‚Äì12 hours typical use with 4√óAA alkaline batteries

## üõ†Ô∏è Wiring Diagram

![Wiring Diagram](WiringDiagram.png)

### Connection Notes
- Power distribution: Use common 3.3V rail from HW-441 regulator
- SPI connections (shared bus):
  - Shared: SCK=18, MOSI=23
  - CC1101 only: MISO=19
  - Separate CS lines: CC1101 CS=27, TFT CS=5
- Button wiring: Connect to GPIO pins with pull-up resistors (INPUT_PULLUP mode)
- Critical: Install 0.1ŒºF (100nF) ceramic bypass capacitors:
  - Between potentiometer GPIO and GND for noise filtering
  - Between CC1101 VCC and GND for power supply decoupling
- Antenna: Connect appropriate 433MHz antenna to CC1101 ANT pin
